              Elon Muskâ€™s
              <br />
              involvement
            </h2>
            <p className="text-desc">
              The first time it was used by Elon was in October 2018 in a tweet
              exchange with @Grimezsz. His account was even locked by Twitter,
              thinking hackers got control of his account.
              <br />
              <br />
              Back then his tweet was retweeted by many known people in the
              cryptocurrency space as @cz_binance @DoveyWan and many others. It
              was used in May 2020 in an exchange with @bitcoin twitter account
              and it played a major role on kickstarting the bitcoin run we saw
              back then.
              <br />
              <br />
              On February 20th 2021, Elon used CCGBTCONE as his PFP on twitter
              along with laser eyes, which seems to have contributed a lot to
              the laser eyes trend that we saw last year.
